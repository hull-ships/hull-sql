# Hull / SQL

### Install the SQL Database Importer to Pass Custom Data to Hull

The SQL Database Importer hooks into your MySQL, PostgreSQL or Redshift database, lets you define a query that will be run on a regular schedule and import the results into Hull.

You can choose to fetch only updated users or the full data set when you build your query. We provide a way to put in a placeholder that will be replaced with the timestamp of the previous query.

Once Users are imported in Hull, only those who have changed will actually be re-sent to other connectors

The SQL imported does not write in your database - we recommend you provide read-only credentials to increase security.

To connect the SQL Database connector, go to Ships. Youâ€™ll need to select your Database type (Postgres or MySQL), enter its location, username and password, enter a Connection String and write a SQL query to extract the right data into Hull.

By default, this will run every 3 hours.
