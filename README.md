#### How to setup the S3 bucket and IAM profile

This article explains how to create an IAM profile and grant access to a S3 bucket : https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/writing-iam-policies-how-to-grant-access-to-an-amazon-s3-bucket/

You might also want to configure your S3 bucket's lifecycle to expire files automatically after a few days.

In the S3 section of your AWS console, go to your bucket's Management tab and add a Lifecycle rule to automatically expire Objects after 7 days.
